Espressif Systems is a privately held, fabless semiconductor company renowned for delivering cost-effective wireless communication microcontrollers. Their innovative solutions are widely adopted in mobile devices and Internet of Things (IoT) applications around the globe.

## General
* Issues with boards (wrong / missing). All issues caused from boards will not be fixed from the maintainer(s). A PR needs to be provided against branch `develop` to solve.
* No support for the Arduino Nora Nano board, issues needs to be solved by the community

## IDE Preparation
Prerequisites:
-	VSCode: git is required for pioarduino to function properly.
-	CLI: Python (v.3.10, v.3.11, 3.12, 3.13 or 3.14) is additionally needed

## Installation

### VSCode Extension
- Download and install [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). [pioarduino IDE](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pioarduino.pioarduino-ide) is on top of it.
- Open the extension manager.
- Search for the `pioarduino ide` extension.
- Install [pioarduino IDE](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pioarduino.pioarduino-ide) extension.

### CLI
```bash
curl -fsSL -o get-platformio.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pioarduino/pioarduino-core-installer/pioarduino/get-platformio.py
python3 get-platformio.py
source ~/.platformio/penv/bin/activate
```
> **Note:** The pioarduino platform installer automatically fixes the virtual environment if a conflict with the system Python is detected.

## Usage

### VSCode
Setup new VSCode pioarduino project.

### CLI
```bash
mkdir my-project && cd my-project
pio project init --board esp32dev
```

# Features

## Filesystem Support

pioarduino provides native support for multiple filesystem options, allowing you to choose the best solution for your project's needs:

- **LittleFS** (default) - Modern wear-leveling filesystem designed specifically for flash memory. Offers excellent reliability and performance for ESP32 projects.
- **SPIFFS** - Simple legacy filesystem. While still functional, LittleFS is recommended for new projects due to better wear-leveling and reliability.
- **FatFS** - Industry-standard FAT filesystem with broad compatibility across platforms and operating systems.

**Quick Start:**

```ini
[env:myenv]
board_build.filesystem = fatfs
```

**Available Commands:**

```bash
pio run -t buildfs        # Build FatFS image
pio run -t uploadfs       # Upload FatFS image
pio run -t download_fatfs # Download and extract FatFS from device
```

See the [arduino-fatfs example](examples/arduino-fatfs/) for a complete working example.

### Stable Arduino
currently espressif Arduino 3.3.9 and IDF v5.5.4.

```ini
[env:stable]
platform = https://github.com/pioarduino/platform-espressif32/releases/download/stable/platform-espressif32.zip
board = ...
...
```

### Development Arduino
espressif Arduino repo branch master and latest compiled Arduino libs

```ini
[env:development]
platform = https://github.com/pioarduino/platform-espressif32.git#develop
board = ...
...
```

###  ESP32-C2, ESP32-C61 and ESP32-solo1 Arduino support (via pioarduino only feature: *Hybrid compile*)
Example configuration:

```ini
[env:esp32-c2-devkitm-1]
platform = https://github.com/pioarduino/platform-espressif32/releases/download/stable/platform-espressif32.zip
framework = arduino
board = esp32-c2-devkitm-1
monitor_speed = 115200

[env:esp32-c61-devkitc1-n8r2]
platform = https://github.com/pioarduino/platform-espressif32/releases/download/stable/platform-espressif32.zip
framework = arduino
board = esp32-c61-devkitc1-n8r2
monitor_speed = 115200

[env:esp32solo1]
platform = https://github.com/pioarduino/platform-espressif32/releases/download/stable/platform-espressif32.zip
framework = arduino
board = esp32-solo1
monitor_speed = 115200

```
